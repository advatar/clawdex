# Status

Active:
- [x] Integrate `Packages/DeepThink` into `macClawdex` and add an optional parallel-agent prepass path in the app runtime.
- [ ] WORK.md execution pass: close remaining task-runtime gaps starting with `tasks follow` live event tailing, then continue with run lifecycle controls (`cancel`/`resume`/`fork`).
  - [x] Add `clawdex tasks follow --run-id <id>` live event tailing and wire it into the CLI.
  - [x] Add `clawdex tasks cancel --run-id <id>` and wire cancellation to app-server `turn/interrupt`.
  - [x] Add `clawdex tasks resume --run-id <id>` wired to app-server `thread/resume`.
  - [x] Add `clawdex tasks fork --run-id <id>` wired to app-server `thread/fork`.
  - [x] Extend daemon `POST /v1/runs` to accept `resumeFromRunId` / `forkFromRunId` for async run continuation.

Upstream Sync (Submodules):
- [x] Establish and follow a regular cadence to pull upstream changes into our forks and then bump the pinned submodule SHAs in this repo (`codex/` from `openai/main`, `openclaw/` from `openclaw/main`).
- [x] On each `openclaw/` bump: scan upstream skills/tooling for new/changed tool usage (`openclaw/src/agents/tools`, `openclaw/src/gateway/protocol/schema`), update `compat/` schemas/specs, and add regression tests before porting required behavior into `clawdex/`.
- [x] Codex sync policy is now explicit: prioritize `openclaw` parity bumps; review/bump `codex` opportunistically when integration deltas require it, and capture port tasks before implementation.
- [x] Keep submodule bump commits isolated (one `chore(submodules)` commit), and land parity/feature ports as separate commits with tests.
  - Latest bump: 2026-02-12 (codex `466be55ab`, openclaw `47cd7e29e`)
  - [x] Backport OpenClaw gateway send parity update: allow attachment-only / media-only sends (`message` optional in gateway send params) with regression tests.
  - [x] Security sweep on each openclaw bump: review published GH advisories + merged security PRs, run dependency audit, and patch/backport applicable fixes.
  - [x] Add `plugins/get-shit-done/` submodule support to the bundled-plugin flow (auto-install + Codex skills sync), including parsing Claude Code-style command frontmatter and rewriting `~/.claude/...` paths to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/...` for portability.
  - [x] Fix plugin disable/remove cleanup for command-derived skills that are not namespaced with the plugin id (e.g. `gsd:*` from `get-shit-done`).
  - [x] Mitigate bundled OpenClaw extension supply risk: block `matrix` plugin installs and skip/auto-remove preinstalled `matrix` while upstream still carries `request` GHSA-p8p7-x288-28g6 (moderate SSRF) transitively.
  - [x] Harden gateway attachment data reads to resolve by attachment id only (ignore index `path` field) and reject traversal-style ids with regression tests.
  - [x] Add daemon admin parity surface: `/admin` dashboard + `/v1/admin/*` APIs for overview, plugins, gateway channels, permissions, and config patching.
  - [x] Backport OpenClaw install-script hardening: add `--ignore-scripts` to npm dependency installs during plugin setup.
  - [x] Backport OpenClaw gateway WS payload policy bump for image uploads (`maxPayload` 8 MiB, `maxBufferedBytes` 16 MiB) with regression coverage.
  - [x] Backport OpenClaw heartbeat scheduler hardening: daemon heartbeat tick errors are logged and rescheduled instead of terminating `clawdexd`.

- [x] Include plugin lifecycle + packaging + MCP/skills sync + mac app UX roadmap details.
- [x] Emphasize Rust-first parity and porting OpenClaw TypeScript components where needed.

Parity Execution (from ROADMAP.md):
- [x] Phase 0: Enforce MCP response strictness + add response-schema regression tests + update `compat/parity-delta.md`.
- [x] Phase 1: Plugin parity (packaging layer, lifecycle parity, metadata/deps validation, permissions mapping, skill/MCP sync hooks).
- [x] Phase 1a: Add OpenClaw plugin manifest support (`openclaw.plugin.json`) + package metadata ingestion.
- [x] Phase 1b: Add plugin install/update semantics (npm spec/archive/path) with dependency install + recorded install source.
- [x] Phase 1c: Align enable/disable/remove flows with OpenClaw semantics + wire skill/MCP sync hooks.
- [x] Phase 1d: Map plugin permission hints into MCP allow/deny + workspace policy overrides (if present).
- [x] Phase 2: Gateway core parity (auth flows, presence/last-seen, message lifecycle/receipts, channel stack order, attachments).
- [x] Phase 3: Server methods + lifecycle parity (registry, versioned handlers, plugin method discovery/reload, compat tests).
- [x] Phase 3a: Add gateway method registry with versioned handlers + methods.list
- [x] Phase 3b: Discover plugin gateway methods from manifests and support reload
- [x] Phase 3c: Add basic compat tests for method registry + reload
- [x] Phase 4: Advanced memory pipeline parity (watchers, batch embeddings queue/retry, cache/eviction, local backend).
- [x] Phase 4a: Use stored embeddings vectors for hybrid scoring (no per-query chunk re-embedding)
- [x] Phase 4b: Backfill embeddings for unchanged files when embeddings config becomes available
- [x] Phase 4c: Add optional memory sync/watch loop (configurable) to keep index warm
- [x] Phase 4d: Batch embeddings queue with retries/backoff + persistent failure metadata
- [x] Phase 4e: Local embeddings backend option (offline / no network)
  - [x] Add a local embeddings provider (Ollama HTTP) that works without an API key.
  - [x] Key embeddings cache + backoff metadata by provider/model to avoid cross-provider poisoning.
- [x] Phase 5: mac app functional parity (timeline, approvals UI, plugin management UI, connectors, attachments, config UI).
  - [x] Add plugin install/update UI (npm spec + local folder/link) and wire into main navigation.
  - [x] Add plugin enable/disable/remove actions to the Plugins UI.
  - [x] Add gateway UI for routes (session keys), receipts, and attachments (upload/list/download).
  - [x] Add chat attachment UX (image picker/preview + send as local image inputs) where supported.
  - [x] Add memory settings controls (enable + embeddings provider/model/sync) to the Settings UI.
  - [x] Add basic task runs timeline: list runs per task + select run + tail/stream events.
- [x] Phase 6: Web/admin parity (dashboards + admin workflows where implemented).
  - [x] Add daemon-served admin API endpoints for plugins, gateway status/channels, permissions, and config patching.
  - [x] Add a minimal web admin dashboard (`/admin`) for session oversight plus plugin/gateway/memory management actions.
  - [x] Add validation coverage for admin API flows and document new endpoints/commands in AI docs.

Notes:
- `TEMPLATE_PACK.md` is the parity checklist: use it later to fill tool schemas, routing rules, and tests, then implement remaining gaps using the name `Clawdex`.
- `MAC_APP.md` already references the Rust UI bridge and the prebuilt binaries helper; keep it in sync if flow changes.
